        <h2 id="technical-difficulties">Introduction</h2>
        Recently I have been working on a personal project that has required that I use a computer graphics API. Instead of taking the easy route and using OpenGL (a software I have used before briefly). I decided to build
        my engine from scratch using Vulkan. This proved to be much more time consuming. Fortunately, it has given me a better understanding of how exactly computer graphics work. In this post, I will attempt to explain what I've learned
        over the past few months with my project. I am not a great software developer, and most of the code in my current project I can attribute to 
        <a>this</a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR" target="_blank"> tutorial series by Brandon Gaela on YouTube. If you are interested more in coding something like this yourself, I would 
        highly reccommend checking this out.
