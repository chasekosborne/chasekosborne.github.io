        <h2 id="technical-difficulties">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            The pair Correlation function \(g(r)\) is a metric on how the density of particles varies from a given distance \(r\) from a reference particle. 
            When the particles you are observing can be approximated as radially symmetric, it is common to denote \(g(r)\) as the radial distribution function.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we are given a volume \(V\) with \(N\) particles, we define the number density as 
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \rho{} = \frac{N}{V}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            In any given sample, we can expect the the average density of particles in an arbitrary sphereical shell of radius \(r\) to \(r+dr\) within the sample to be 
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \rho{}g(r)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course in the case of an ideal gas, where particles do not interact with eachother and therefore have no variation in density (in other words
            meaning they are uniformly distributed) \(g(r) = 1\).
        </p>

        <h2 id="technical-difficulties">Technical Notes</h2>
            This function obfuscates a lot of the statistical mechanics embedded in it. Meaning if you'd wanted to calculate \(g(r)\) yourself.
            Your first step would be to calculate the pair correlation function from a sample, even in the simplest case of an ideal gas you would likely get something 
            that looked like
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="../image/paircorrelation/radial_distribution.gif" alt="" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="caption-label">Figure 1.</span> Radial distribution function calculated from sample point (left), followed with a histogram of the pair
                 correlation function (right), compared to its theoretical value. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is because the pair corelation is an <i>ensemble average</i> of densities of particles at a given distance from a reference particle. To get meaningful
            results, we need to take the average of the pair correlation function over many samples.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways we can do so: <br>
            <strong>Microstate Average</strong> - The average over the reference particles in a single sample. <br>
            <strong>Ensemble Average</strong> - The average over various samples of possible states in the system.
        </p>

            <div class="caption">
                <span class="caption-label">Figure 2.</span> Radial distribution function calculated from sample point (left), followed with a microstate average of 
                the pair correlation function (right), compared to its theoretical value. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Here, we will mainly concern ourselves with the microstate average, since we are only concerned with the pair correlation function of a single sample.
            Expections are otherwise clarified.
        </p>
        <p>
            One final thing to note about running simulations for a given pair correlation function. Any boundry method that isn't periodic will introduce artifacts
            to some degree. It may increase in the amount of randomness at high radii, as well as introduce a positive/negative bias in the pair correlation function.
