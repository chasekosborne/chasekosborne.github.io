        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            For me, Griffiths Quantum Mechanics was the textbook used to cover topics in my introductory Quantum Mechanics course. 
            Spin and angular momentum is brielfy discussed, in the textbook, at the very end of section 4.4.3 the following statement
            is made.
            <blockquote> 
            In a mathematical sense this is all applied group theory
            —what we are talking about is the decomposition of the direct product of two irreducible representations of
            the rotation group into a direct sum of irreducible representations (you can quote that, to impress your
            friends).
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            Because I do not have friends, here you are to read it.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            A lot of elementary Quantum Mechanics is taught in a way such that most formalism is brushed under the rug.
            Given that most of the foundational mathematics built around Quantum Mechanics is worth an entire degree in mathematics on its own.
            Omission of some of the mathematics related is for good reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            The whole purpose of this post is to (hopefully) clear some of the confusion about spin as it relates to Quantum Mechanics.
            Built from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> I am assuming some baseline knowledge of electromagnetism and classical mechanics.
        </p>
    

        <h2 id="Spin">Spin</h2>
        <h3>Classical Angular Momentum </h3>
        <p>
            To describe spin, we must first cover over angular momentum. In classical mechanics, this
            is a metric on the rotational motion of an object, alongside its tendency to continue rotating. With respect to a mass about a
            central axis of rotation.
        </p>
        \[ 
        \tag{1} \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times{} \vec{p}
        \]
        <p>
            Here, \(\vec{r}\) serves as the distance from the axis of rotation, and \( \vec{p}\) is the linear momentum of the object as
            it moves around a central axis. Where the direction of the vectors determined from the cross product can be determined by the right-hand 
            rule.
        </p>
        ** Include diagram
        <h3>Classical Spin</h3>
        <p>
            Spin on the other hand, is a similar metric with the the central axis rotation now <i>about the objects center of mass.</i>
        </p>
        \[ 
        \vec{S} = I\vec{w}
        \]
        <p>
            Here our <i>moment of intertia</i> \( I \) is the tendency to keep rotating, and the <i>angular velocity</i> \( \vec{\omega{}} \)  
            is the rotational motion. Now this is with the assumption that we are rotating the object about its axis of symmetry, but since
            we are mainly dealing with objects with spherical symmetry, this is not a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, we can look at this spin classically and make note that computing this quantity is functionally similar to
            computing the angular mometnum of a lot of small mass components making up the object that is spinning, we call this a rigid body,
            and all mass component \(dm\) have the same angular velocity \(\vec{\omega{}}\).
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance the formula for the angular momentum of a mass of a finite volume about a central axis is:
        </p>
        \[
        \tag {2} \vec{L} = \int{}\vec{r}\times{}(\vec{v}dm)
        \]
        <p>By the identity (and cyclic permutations of cross products) we have the following formulas</p>
        \[
        \vec{\omega{}} = \vec{r} \times{} \vec{v} \\
        \vec{v} = \vec{\omega{}} \times{} \vec{r} 
        \]
        <p> Plugging this back into (2) we get:</p>
        \[
        \vec{L} = \int{}\vec{r}\times{}(\vec{\omega{}} \times{} \vec{r})dm
        \]
        <p>by the BAC-CAB identity we can expand the triple product,</p>
        \[
        \vec{L} = \int{} \left[ (\vec{r}\cdot{}\vec{r})\vec{\omega{}} - (\vec{r}\cdot{}\vec{\omega})\vec{r} \right]dm \\
        \]
        <p>given that \(\vec{\omega{}}\) and \(\vec{r}\) are orthogonal, and that </p>
        \[
        \vec{L} = \left[ \int{} r^{2}dm \right] \vec{\omega{}}
        \]
        <p>At this point we can define this integral to be our moment of inertia \(I\).</p>
        <p>
            We will come back to this notion of angular momentum and spin when we discuss the quantum mechanical analog to these
            quantities. For now we will make note of these properties.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            We are only going to concern ourselves with rotation about spherically symmetric objects. Since that is all that is needed.
            Rotations dealing with asymmetric objects (and rotations off their axis of symmetry) call for more complicated procedures. 
            In this case, computing angular momentum is fairly straightforward, and with a quick google search you can find many formulas
            to get this quantity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of spherical symmetry, we have two options to compute moment of inertia, for the case of a
            point mass located at the center of rotation (\( I = m\)) where \(m\) is the mass of the point object. For a sphere with a solid
            volume, this becomes.
            \[
            \int{I}
            \]

        </p> -->
        <h3>Magnetic Dipole Moment </h3>
        <p>
            So, how can we measure these rotations on a scale small enough to measure potential quantum mechanical effects? 
            We will begin with the description of a loop of current flowing through wire in a uniform magnetic field \(\vec{B}\).
            We begin with the Lorentz force law:
        </p>
        \[
        \tag{3} \vec{F} = q\vec{E}+q(\vec{v}\times{}\vec{B})
        \]
        <!-- \[
        \tag{4} \vec{\nabla{}}\times{}\vec{E} = -\frac{d\vec{B}}{dt}
        \] -->
        <p>
            For sake of simplicity, we are going to assume a steady current \( \vec{E}_{net}=\vec{0}\), and that we are only concerned with some current
            loop \(I = nAv_{d}q \) where \(n\) is the number density \(q\) is the charge, \(A\) is the cross sectional area of the
            wire, and \( v_{d}\) is the drift velocity of the charge carriers in the wire.
        </p>
        <p>If we consider a differentiably small section of the wire \(dl\) the number of charge carriers in the wire is</p>
        \[
        dN = nAdl
        \]
        <p>thus each charge carrier in this section of the wire experiences a force by equation (3),</p>
        \[
        d\vec{F} = dNq(\vec{v_d}\times{}\vec{B}) \\
        d\vec{F} = nAdlq(\vec{v_d}\times{}\vec{B})
        \]
        <p>assuming that the velocity of the charge carriers to be in the same direction as the loop of the wire
        \(\vec{v_{d}}=v_{d}\hat{l} \).</p>
        \[
        d\vec{F} = nAv_{d}q(d\vec{l}\times{}\vec{B}) \\
        d\vec{F} = I(d\vec{l}\times{}\vec{B})
        \]
        <p>this generates a torque, which can be calculated using the definition</p>
        \[
        \vec{\tau{}} = \oint{}\vec{r}\times{}d\vec{F} \\
        \vec{\tau{}} = \oint{}\vec{r}\times{}I(d\vec{l}\times{}\vec{B}) \\
        \]
        <p>we can rearrange the vector triple product by cyclic permutation (in the case of the triple product it is anticommutative)</p>
        \[
        \vec{\tau{}} = -I\left[ \vec{B} \times{} \oint{}\vec{r}\times{}d\vec{l} \right]
         \]
        <p>where the integral is equal to the cross sectional area of the wire \(\vec{A}\) </p>
        \[
        \vec{\tau{}} = -I\left[ \vec{B} \times{} \vec{A} \right]
        \]
        swapping components \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) we get the following formula,
        \[
        \vec{\tau{}} = I\vec{A} \times{} \vec{B}
        \]
        from this we define the <b>magnetic dipole moment</b>:
        \[
        \vec{\mu{}} = I\vec{A}
        \]
        <p>
            lets first review what we have done. We have an amperian loop of current \(I\) that for all purposes can be in any orientation.
            This loop by Faraday's law generates its own magnetic field pointing out of the loop. When this loop is subjected to an external
            magnetic field, this loop will experience torque to reorient the loop such that its dipole moment is parallel with the external
            magnetic field.
        </p>

        <p>
            The magnetic diplole moment is crucial to understanding the concept of spin as it is directly related to the property of angular
            momentum. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If we assume an amperian loop and ignore the orientation for a moment. The magnetic moment becomes
        </p>
        \[ \mu{} = IA \]
        \[ \mu{} = \left( \frac{qv}{2\pi{}r} \right)(\pi{}r^{2}) \]
        \[ \mu{} = \frac{qvr}{2} \]
        <p>Given the definition of the angular momentum \(L = mvr\) from equation (1), we obtain the identity</p>
        \[ 
        \mu{} = \frac{q}{2m}L 
        \]
        <p>
            This is a common identity for determining the angular momentum of charged particles even today. Though with the exception
            of a constant \(g\)
        </p>
        \[ 
            \tag{4} \vec{\mu{}} = g\frac{q}{2m}\vec{L} 
        \]
        <p>
            which is known as the g-factor. For the amperian loops used in this example, this factor is set to \( g=1\).
            This has to do with the coupling of a particle’s spin to the magnetic field it generates. This effect arises from
            relativistic quantum mechanics, and a full derivation of the g-factor lies beyond the scope of this discussion
            (though it may be worth revisiting in the future).
