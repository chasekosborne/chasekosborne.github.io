        <h2 id="introduction">My Experience With Programming</h2>

        <p>
            I have been writing code since right around 12 years old, so about 8 years. And only recently within the past year or so I have really started to put some 
            serious time into getting good at writing code. From my time in college starting around 2021, AI as a tool has been iterated over and improved upon at a rapid pace.
            For me, it was always somewhat demotivating seeing the AI tools get better and better while I was still writing at the same rate. What might
            take me a few hours to write up a python script, something like ChatGPT, or Deepseek could do what felt like near instantaneously. 
        </p>

        <p>
            With this, I have often run into mental blocks where, no matter how much I tried to force myself to write code, there was always this notion in the back of my mind
             that I was doing it the hard way, that I could just go online to ChatGPT, or whatever AI tool I could get available for free at the time (college is expensive).
              And sometimes I did, and it was really handy for those moments. But I couldn't help but feel, especially in my research, that I was missing out on a lot of
               the deeper concepts and subtleties that came with writing code for doing careful analysis when I relied on AI too much.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is one of the first posts where I really get into personal opinion, a lot of this reflects my own personal sentiments on the topic, and since AI is
             something that has existed for the entirety of my professional life. I felt compelled to speak about it and give my thoughts on how that has affected me, 
             good and bad. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

        <p>
            For the most part, I think using AI for menial coding tasks such as writing scripts or formatting and adding in smaller code snippets has been a huge time saver.
            Currently, I am using Cursor to write this post, and it is fantastic, it saves me a lot of the time on formatting and allows me to focus more on the content rather
            than copy pasting the same snippets over and over again. And is frankly the reason I came straight from my final exam to write this post.
